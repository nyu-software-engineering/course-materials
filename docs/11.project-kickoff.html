# Ready, Set, Go!

---

## Kickoff

Teams are by now well into their projects.  Let's make sure your workflow and expectations are in order.

---

## Sprints

Work is divided into increments:
- Sprint 0 - learn your dev environment and workflow
- Sprint 1 - build out the most fundamental featuress
- Sprint 2 - implement secondary features
- Sprint 3 - make the app fully usable but rough
- Sprint 4 - finesse what you've done

---

## Sprint 0

Sprint 0 is intend to give you time to:
- Set up and become familiar with your development environment
- Teach yourself technologies you don't already know
- Set up team communications and workflows

It is up to you to use this time wisely.

By Sprint 1, you are expected to be able to be a contributing team member.

---

## Expectations

- Teams [divide labor](#division-of-labor) fairly and wisely.
- Teams communicate primarily in-person and through [Slack](#slack).
- Teams use [GitHub](#github) as both a central code repository and a project management tool.
- The [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) represents the full list of user requirements of the project.
- Teams estimate work using [Planning Poker](#planning-poker) cards.
- A [Sprint Backlog](#sprint backlog) shows which user requirements are being worked on during the current Sprint.
- A [Task Boards](#task-boards) shows the up-to-date status of all work at all times.
- Individuals use [Git](#git) systematically to isolate code and track changes.
- Teams meet primarily in person for [Daily Standups](#daily-standups).
- **At the end of each Sprint is the release of a working, but incomplete, product**.

# Division of Labor

---

## Wise Use of Human Resources

- Do *not* dedicate some humans to front-end development and others to back-end - **share all responsibilities**.
- Do *not* let some members do all the database work - **share the responsibilities**.
- Do *teach* each other what some of you know - **if teammates flounder, the whole team will suffer**.
- Do *not* allow one person to dominate the role of Product Owner - **switch roles every Sprint**.
- Do *not* allow one person to dominate the role of Scrum Master - **switch every Sprint**.
- Do *not* assume your stakeholders (Professor, Tutor, Grader) will always tell you what to do and how to do it - **take initiative**.

---

class: center, middle
name: slack

# Slack

---

## Channels

Each team must have two private channels set up in Slack, e.g.:
- `team_octapus` - general discussion
- `team_octapus_standups` - after each standup, document each member's answers to the three questions

Key stakeholders - professor, tutor, grader - must be invited.

---

## Organization

Each team is a member of the larger course organization.

All teams are using the same general technologies and facing the same problems.

Communicate with other teams via Slack.  Help each other.  Take initiative.

---

## Coffee & Donuts

A bot named `@donut` lives in Slack.  

@donut will randomly pair organization members together every week and invite them to go out for coffee and donuts (or whatever).

Post a selfie of your @donut date to the `#donut-friends` channel for extra credit.  Tag the people in the photo with their Slack handles.

class: center, middle
name: github

# GitHub

---

## Repository

All team members have access to their project's GitHub repository.

All repositories must include:
- **README.md** - an always up-to-date overview of the project
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - detailed instructions that govern participation in the project
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - initial product requirements that will be out-of-date soon
- **.gitignore** - a Git settings file that instructs git to not track certain directories and files

---

## Gitignore

Each repository must include a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory that instructs git to not track certain files and directories.

This file must instruct git to ignore (i.e. not track):
- **platform code** - e.g. React.js itself, Node.js itself, etc
- **3rd party library code** - e.g. any installed Node.js modules, python packages, etc
- **any files containing authentication credentials** - e.g. database username/password, Spotify API credentials, etc.
- **any files containing personal information** - e.g. if your app stores data about users in files or databases, don't track those

Uses [this example `.gitignore` file](https://gist.github.com/bloombar/1bbca4aafb267920ac220864d99d6c8f) as a starting point, and add to it as necessary.

# Product Backlog

---

## User Stories

Before work on a project can begin, it must have an initial Product Backlog - a set of user requirements for the project written in User Story form.

---

## Issues

Every GitHub repository has an `Issues` tab where User Stories in the Product Backlog should be written and stored.
- User Stories in the Product Backlog must be listed in order of importance

![GitHub user story issues](../images/github_issues_user_stories.png)

---

## Label

Create an Issue for each User Story in the Product Backlog and assign it the `user story` label to differentiate it from other types of Issues.

---

name: issue-numbers

## Issue Numbers

Once created, each Issue in GitHub is automatically assigned a unique Issue number.  

You will use these numbers:
- to link up [Tasks](#tasks) to their associated User Stories.
- to link up Git [branches](#git-branches) to the issues they are meant to implement

![GitHub issue numbers](../images/github_issues_numbers.png)

---

## Issue Templates

Your use of GitHub's Isssues feature must also make use of GitHub Issue Templates:
1. [Download a set of Issue Template Markdown files](https://gist.github.com/bloombar/3ba6ddd69b6364bf20a56d65ad590bd1/archive/a0aa9130ce8d86630669b67d1ec8ddae96e5f379.zip).
2. Place these example Markdown files into a directory in your repository named `.github`/`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
3. Push them to the GitHub central repository.
4. Now every time you create a new User Story, Task, or Spike, GitHub will offer for you to use one these as a starter template.

# Planning Poker

---

## Fibonacci

Every team must print a set of Fibonacci-based planning poker cards for each team member.  
- Find a deck you like or design your own.  
- Include a link to your deck on the CONTRIBUTING.md file. 
- Bring them to Sprint Planning meetings.

![Planning poker cards](../images/agile_planning_poker.png)

---

## Work Estimation

At the start of each Sprint, team members discuss each User Story they are considering including in the new Sprint.

The group quickly assigns each User Story an estimated level of effort using Planning Poker.

---

# Sprint Backlogs

---

## Selecting User Stories

Those User Stories selected for the current Sprint are added to the Sprint Backlog.

In addition to the basic requirements for User Stories in the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog), User Stories in the Sprint Backlog must be assigned:
- a GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint
- an Estimate of Effort required to complete the User Story
- a set of Acceptance Criteria for the User Story

![GitHub issue milestones](../images/github_issues_milestones.png)

---

name: tasks

## Tasks

Each User Story selected for the current Sprint is immediately broken up into Tasks.

A `Task` is a unit of work that would ideally take one developer one day.

---

## Task Requirements

- The description of each Task includes a reference to the User Story to which it belongs - writing the User Story's Issue ID number, e.g. #22, in the Task description will create a link to it.
- Each Task is assigned to a specific developer
- Each Task is saved as a GitHub Issue with the label, "task".
- Each Task is assigned the GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint.

![GitHub issue tasks](../images/github_issues_tasks.png)

---

## Spikes

Any work to be done that does not relate directly to a user requirement is documented as a Spike.

In GitHub, spikes are treated like Tasks in all respects except that they are labeled "spike", not "task".

---

## Spike Requirements

- Each Spike is assigned to a specific developer
- Each Spike is saved as a GitHub Issue with the label, "spike".
- Each Spike is assigned the GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint.

![GitHub issue spikes](../images/github_issues_spikes.png)

---

## Proper Attribution

If the nature of the work requires a particular Task or Spike to be done independently by each developer, it must be split into separate Tasks or Spikes with each assigned to a single team member.

For example:
- If all team members must learn Node.js during Sprint 0, then each team member has an individual responsibility to complete this.  
- There must be a distinct Spike on the Task Board for each team member indicating the current status of their personal work completing this.

---

# Task Boards

---

## Concept

Each GitHub repository has a `Projects` tab, where Task Boards can be made.

Make one Task Board for each Sprint.  Call them:
- Sprint 0 Task Board
- Sprint 1 Task Board
- Sprint 2 Task Board
- Sprint 3 Task Board
- Sprint 4 Task Board

---

## Columns

Each Task Board must have the following columns:
- *Sprint Backlog (User Stories)* - the list of User Stories selected for this Sprint.
- *To Do (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that have not yet begun
- *In Process (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are currently being worked on 
- *Awaiting Review (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are complete and awaiting peer review
- *Done (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are complete and have passed peer review.

![GitHub task board columns](../images/github_task_board_columns.png)

---

## Starting State

At the start of each Sprint, the current Task Board in GitHub must contain:
- the full list of User Stories selected for this Sprint in the "Sprint Backlog (User Stories)" column
- the full list of Tasks and Spikes in the "To Do (Tasks)" column



---

## Changing State

The state of the Task Board must be kept up-to-date at all times.
- **User Stories always stay in the "Sprint Backlog" column**
- **Tasks and Spikes move around** - as developers work on their own assigned Tasks and Spikes, they are personally responsible for moving them to the appropriate columns.

---

## Missing Work

Your performance evaluation/grade depends upon you accurately listing all work you are doing on the Task Board at all times.

**If you are doing work whose existence or status is not accurately reflected on the Task Board, you are not doing Agile Development and will not receive credit for it.**

---

name: git

# Git

---

## Matching Credentials

The Git username and email you use on your development machine must match your GitHub account username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Foo Barstein"
git config --global user.email fb1258@nyu.edu
```

---

## Clone

Each team member must clone the remote GitHub repository to their development machine.

---

name: git-branches

## Branches

Requirements:
- Make all changes to the code in isolated branches.
- Create a new branch for every Task or Spike under development.  
- Never work directly in the `master` branch.
- Name branches after the User Story and Task/Spike which they are intended to implement

Examples:

- A branch intended to implement Task #9, which is part of User Story #13:
```bash
git checkout -b user-story/13/task/9/implement-user-login
```

- A branch intended to implement Task #9, which is part of User Story #13:
```bash
git checkout -b spike/27/learn-react-js
```

---

## Peer Review

The developer who makes changes must never be the one to merge their own branch into the trunk.
1. The developer making changes must push their completed branch to GitHub and then issue a Pull request to the `master` branch
2. The same developer must, of course, update the position of the relevant Task that this branch implements on the Task Board.
3. A second developer must review the changes in the pull request, approve them if good, and merge them into `master`.

# Daily Standups

---

## Concept

Every morning, the entire development team gets together.  Everyone quickly and honestly answers three questions:
1. What did you do yesterday (or since last meeting)?
2. What are you doing today (or until next meeting)?
3. Do you have any problems that are blocking your progress?

---

## Documentation

The current Scrum Master must document each team member's answers to the three questions and post them to their team's Slack standups channel.

Include the Slack handle of each member and their responses, e.g.

```
@foo_barstein:
- did: Completed 95% unit testing code coverage of codebase
- doing: Implementing the Observer design pattern
- blocking: Nothing
```

---

## Honesty

All teams must include in their Team Norms that team members agree to answer the Daily Standup three questions honestly and fully.

It is in all team members' interests to report blocking problems or underperforming team members to the stakeholders immediately.

If a team member is doing the same work for several Standups in a row, yet is not reporting any blocking problems, this is a sign of a major problem.
