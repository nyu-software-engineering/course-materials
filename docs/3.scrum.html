# Agile manifesto

--

## Concept
In 2001, at The Lodge at the Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah, 17 prestigious developers got together to talk shop.

--

- They emerged shortly thereafter with the **Agile Manifesto**, a very short document.

---

template: manifesto

## The text
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
>
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> - _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
> - _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
> - _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
> - _Responding to change_ over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>
> -[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org)

## Implementation
The Agile manifesto inspired a world of developers, but there were no details on how to implement it.

--

- Various practical implementation frameworks quickly emerged.

--

- [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) is one of these.

# Scrum framework

--

template: scrum

## Concept
The Scrum framework is a recipe for achieving agile development by prescribing a strict set of...

--

- Roles

--

- Events

--

- Artifacts

---

name: roles

# Roles

---

template: roles

## Concept
Scrum defines four distinct roles:

--

- Product owner

--

- Scrum master

--

- Developer

--

- Stakeholder

--

It is possible, although not adviseable, for one person to perform more than one of these roles.

---

template: roles

## Product owner

The Product Owner represents the business interests within the team.

--

- The Product Owner is the team member who communicates directly with the client.

--

- The Product Owner is the team member who maintains and prioritizes the list of features to be implemented.

---

template: roles

## Scrum master

The Scrum Master represents the Scrum framework within the team.

--

- The Scrum Master is a "**servant leader**", not a manager.

--

- The Scrum Master ensures the team is following the Scrum framework.

---

template: roles

## Developer

Developers implement the work laid out by the Product Owner.

--

- Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to properly define and scope the work.

--

- Developers are autonomous and decide in what manner to do the work.

---

template: roles

## Stakeholder

Stakeholders are people external to the team who have an important voice.

--

- Stakeholders could be the client, or executives in the development company.

--

- Stakeholders can cause problems if not kept in close communication with the team.

# Events

--

## Concept
Scrum defines seven ritual events for different purposes:

--

- Backlog creation

--

- Sprint planning

--

- Daily scrum

--

- Backlog grooming

--

- Sprint review

--

- Stakeholder demo

--

- Team retrospective

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

The Product Backlog is a list of features that the project is intended to implement. These featuress are written in a specific style and called "**User Stories**".

--

- The Product Owner, by speaking with Stakeholders, drafts and maintains the Product Backlog at the start of a project.

--

- The features in the Product Backlog are ordered, with the most important User Stories on top of the list.

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

### User stories

User Stories are written in the following form:

> As a **\_\_\_**, I want to **\_\_\_**, so that **\_\_\_**

--

- the first blank is filled in with a user role or type of user

--

- the second blank is filled in with a goal

--

- the third blank is filled in with a reason

--

These are written in non-technical language by the Product Owner.

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

### User stories

User Stories should follow the _INVEST_ acronym:

- **I**ndependent - user stories do not depend on one-another

--

- **N**egotiable - can be canceled or changed at any time

--

- **V**aluable - meaningful stories

--

- **E**stimable - must be descriptive and small enough to be able to easily estimate work for it.

--

- **S**mall - story is small enough to be completed in one sprint

--

- **T**estable - story contains enough clarity to be able to easily design a test for it

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

### User stories

User Stories each have a set of **Acceptance Criteria**.

--

- This represents the minimum requirements for the User Story to be considered done.

--

- The Product Owner and Developers collaborativeley come up with this list of requirements.

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

### User stories

User Stories each have an **Estimation of Effort**

--

- The Developers determine how much work is involved in the user story.

--

- **Planning Poker** is a popular technique for determining this.

---

template: events

## Backlog creation

### Spikes

Sometimes work needs to be done that is not end-user-facing, such as setting up a particular development environment.

--

Such a piece of work is called a _Spike_.

---

template: events

## Sprint planning

In Scrum, work is divided into increments called "sprints". Sprints typically last several weeks.

--

- At the start of each Sprint, the entire team (including Product Owner) gets together and decides which features (i.e. User Stories) to work on in this Sprint.

--

- The Product Owner presents the list of User Stories in the Product Backlog, from top to bottom.

--

- The team discusses and collaboratively agrees on which User Stories to do in this Sprint.

--

- The Developers break up each User Story into discrete Tasks - units of work that are doable by one developer in about one day.

---

template: events

## Sprint planning

The team discusses and collaboratively agrees on which User Stories to do in this Sprint. These are added to the Sprint Backlog.

--

- The Developers break up each User Story in the Sprint Backlog into discrete Tasks - units of work that are doable by one developer in about one day.

--

- Each task is assigned to a specific developer.

--

- The Developers get to work.

---

template: events

## Daily Scrum

Every day, the Scrum Master and Developers get together to discuss status.  Each Developer answers three questions:

--

- What have you done since last time?

--

- What are you doing now?

--

- Is there anything blocking your progress?

--

Blocking problems are addressed by the Scrum Master, who must seek help externally.

---

# Events

## Backlog Grooming

Each Sprint, the Product Owner maintains the Product Backlog - adding new User Stories, modifying old ones, etc.

--

- At the mid-point of each Sprint, the entire team (including Product Owner) gets together to discuss these additions.

--

- The team discusses the new User Stories, and the Product Manager orders them appropriately in the Product Backlog.

--

- No User Stories are ever added to the current Sprint, but they can be addressed in subsequent Sprints.

---

# Events

## Sprint review

At the end of each Sprint, the entire team (including Product Owner) meet to discuss the work that has been done.

--

- Unfinished User Stories are returned to the Product Backlog.

--

- The team agrees what is good enough to show to the Stakeholders.

---

# Events

## Stakeholder demo

The entire team demonstrates the work to the Stakeholders.

--

- The Product Owner often leads the demo, althogh may do so, if helpful.

--

- Stakeholders give feedback, suggest additions, changes, etc.

--

- The Product Owner adds any new User Stories requested by the Stakeholders to the Product Backlog.

---

# Events

## Team retrospective

The team discusses what happened in this sprint.

--

- How did the demo go?

--

- What worked well?

--

- What went poorly?

--

- How can we improve next time?

---

name: communications

# Communications

# Communications

--

## Concept
It is expected in Scrum that team members and Stakeholders always know the status of work currently being done.

--

- The primary document outlining the status of thee project is the Task Board.

---

# Communications

## Task Board

The Task board divides the activities in the current Sprint into the simple categories, such as:

--

- **Sprint Backlog** - list of all the User Stories that are being worked on this Sprint.

--

- **To Do** - a list of all the Tasks that have not yet been started,

--

- **In Process** - a list of the Tasks that are currently in-progress.

--

- **Awaiting Review** - a list of the Tasks that are Awaiting review by another team member.

--

- **Done** - a list of the Tasks that have been reviewed and are considered complete.

--

The Task Board must be kept up-to-date at all times by the Product Owner and Developers.

# Team harmony

--

## Concept

It is critical that all team members be able to see the accurate status of all Tasks by all Developers.

--

- It is a good idea to draft a set of **Team Norms** that govern team member behavior.

--

- The entire team will notice when a member is not performing their duties, since it will obviously come up in the Dialy Scrum meetings and reviews of the Task Board.

--

- It is understood that the entire team will inform the boss early if any team member is not performing their duties, since it is a blocking problem.
