# Overview

Individual personality psychology and group psychology play an important role in team harmony and performance.

While there is no single formula for success, having an understanding of how you perceive otherss and are yourself perceived by others may help.

# The Human Condition

> 
> It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built up upon a renunciation of instinct....
> 

-Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and its Discontents"

## Concept

As popularized in the early 20th century by Freud's "[Civilization and its Discontents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents)" and Hermann Hesse's "[Steppenwolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(novel))", humans have long been accused of harboring conflicting motivations:
- to be an individual
- to belong to a group

## Solution

While there is no solution, there are strategies for mitigating the impact of this inherent conflict on team performance.

For team harmony, it may help to understand an individual's motivations and try to provide for their needs.

# Motivation

> 
> When people appear to be something other than good and decent, it is only because they are reacting to stress, pain, or the deprivation of basic human needs such as security, love, and self-esteem.
> 

-Abraham Maslow, "Toward a Psychology of Being"

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

In the mid-20th century, a social scientist named Abraham Maslow proposed a set of needs of humans in order to explain motivation (or the lack thereof):
1. **Physiological needs** - food, water, sleep, shelter, etc.
2. **Safety** - personal, financial, and other forms of safety
3. **Social belonging** - a need for the feeling of belongingness, social acceptance, and love
4. **Esteem** - recognition, respect, and the need for status
5. **Self-actualization** - a desire to accomplish everything one can... to maximize one's potential!

The idea was that you cannot achieve higher needs without satisfying lower needs.

## Maslow's Pyramid

Where does software development fit in this pyramid?

## Tricks of the trade

Safety:
- no guns at work
- systems for handling reports of abuse and harrassment

Social belonging:
- provide communal facilities and activities
- encourage informal communication

Esteem:
- recognize achievements of individuals
- give appropriate rewards

Self-realization:
- training - people want to learn more
- responsibility - let individuals have a stake in the work

# Personality Types

> 
> Whatever the circumstances of your life, the understanding of type can make your perceptions clearer, your judgements sounder, and your life closer to your heart's desire.
> 

-Isabel Briggs Myers

## Myers-Briggs

Based on [Jung's theory of personality](https://www.psychestudy.com/general/personality/carl-jung-theory), the Myers-Briggs set of personality dualities are quite popular in corporate America human resources practices.

> When you're rich, they think you really know!

-[Tevye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevye), an empoverished milkman dreaming of a life full of wealth and esteem says, in the classic Yiddish story, "[Fiddler on the Roof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBHZFYpQ6nc)"
