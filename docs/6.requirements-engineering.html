# Overview

# Overview

Requirements engineering is the disciplined process of defining what a project requires to be done and how it must be done.

# Motivations

---

# Motivations

Requirements provide several benefits to a project:
- Clearly defining the features and functionality that must be developed
- Defining the performance, security, and maintainaibility of the system
- Assisting in the cost and time estimates of the project
- Avoiding disputes by having all parties agree on what is to be done

# Types

---

# Types

There are two top-level categories of requirements:
- Functional
- Non-functional

---

# Types
## Functional requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do, in layman's terms, including:
- Services the system must provide to its users
- How the system must behave in particular situations
- What outputs the system must provide in response to particular inputs

---

# Types
## Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements specify constraints on either the system or the development process, including:
- Timing constraints
- Constraints on the development process
- Constraints on technologies that must or must not be used
- Standards that must be followed by the project
- Performance - e.g. speed, size, memory, uptime, reliability, load handling, portability

# User Requirements

---

# User Requirements

A type of functional requirement focused on the user experience.

Define what a user must be able to do with the system, written in layman's terms.

There are two popular ways of writing user requirements:
- Use Cases
- User Stories

---

# User Requirements
## Use Cases

Describe how an *actor* achieves their *goals* using the system.

A list of actions and events involved in a specific user interaction.

---

# User Requirements
## Use Cases

At a minimum contains:
- *Title* - a short phrases with an active verb describing the goal of the interaction
- *Actor* - the person or system who desires the goal
- *Scenario* - step-by-step description of how the goal is achieved by the actor

---

# User Requirements
## Use Cases

Example:

> Title: Purchase items
> 
> Actor: Customer
> 
> Scenario: Customer reviews items in shopping cart.  Customer provides payment and shipping information.  System validates payment information and responds with a confirmation of order and provides order number that Customer can use to check on order status.  System will send Customer a confirmation of order details and tracking number in an email.

---

# User Requirements
## Use Cases

Written use cases often are accompanied by a Unified Modeling Diagram Language (UML) diagram:

---

# User Requirements
## User Stories

An alternative to Use Cases, written in user-centric language:

As a ___, I want ___, so I can ___.
- First blank is filled with the actor
- Second blank is filled with the goal
- Third blan is filled with the motivation

---

# User Requirements
## User Stories

Each User Story also includes:
- Estimated level of effort 
- Acceptance criteria

---

# User Requirements
## User Stories

Example:

> As a customer, I want to sign up so I can start placing orders.
>
> Effort: M
> 
> Acceptance criteria:
> 1) Customer name is captured and saved
> 2) Customer email is captured and saved
> 3) Customer phone number is captured and saved
> 4) Customer password is captured and saved
> 5) Invalid name, email, phone, and passwords are rejected
> 6) Customer is signed in automatically after registration

# Elicitation

---

# Elicitation

How do you gather requirements?
- Interviews
- Observatiion
- Intuition

---

# Elicitation
## Interviews

It would typically be a mistake not to interview:
- Key stakeholders
- A representative sample of end-users

---

# Elicitation
## Interviews

An interview can either be conducted in an *open* or *closed* manner.
- *Open* interviews are open-ended discussions where the conversation meanders.
- *Closed* interviews follow a prepared set of questions and topics for discussion.

---

# Elicitation
## Observation

Observing end-users achieving their goals without your system, such as with...
- an *alternative system* or solution
- a *prototype* of your intended system
- an *earlier version* of your system

---

# Elicitation
## Observation

Similarly to interviews, observation can either be active or passive.
- *Scripted* - observer asks the user to perform certain tasks and then records how they complete it.
- *Unscripted* - the observer silentyly watchess the user performing their everyday tasks without interruption.

---

# Elicitation
## Intuition

Realistically, a requirements engineer (who may also be a software engineer) already has preeconceived notions of what users might want to do with the system based on their experience.
