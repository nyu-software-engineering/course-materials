# Overview

---

## Concept

Change management is the streamlined approach to handling changes in software.

Changes are typically required for one of a few reasons:

1. New features
2. Bug fixes
3. Maintenance due to changes in dependencies

# Five Phases

---

## Concept

Work on any given change request goes through each of several phases

1. Submission
1. Validation
1. Assessment
1. Feasibility
1. Implementation

---

## Phase 1: Submission

Most change management systems allow their stakeholders to submit '**change requests**' using a form.

- The form is often filled out in response to stakeholder feedback
- All metadata details of the change request are logged - date/time, author, type, status, etc.

---

## Phase 2: Validation

The change request is then determined to be valid or invalid and the result is logged in the change request document.

Common reasons for invalidity of a change request:

- high-level business reasons
- duplicate of previous change request
- results from end-user or stakeholder misunderstanding of product functionality

---

## Phase 3: Assessment

The time, effort and ultimately cost of implementing the change is estimated.

- this is usually handled by the development team.
- includes estimates of work for all components/systems that may be impacted by proposed changes

---

## Phase 4: Feasibility

Is the change worth doing... now?

Questions typically asked to help answer that question:

- what is the impact of **not** making the change?
- what are the benefits of making the change?
- how many end-users will be affected by the change?
- what is the cost of making the change?
- when is the proper time to implement such a change?

---

## Phase 5: Implementation

If deemed feasible, the developers implement the change the usual way.

The status of the change request is updated as necessary.
