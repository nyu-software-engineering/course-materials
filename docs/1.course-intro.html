## Course description

We learn how to build software following contemporary best practices.

--

This course is as much about _process_ as it is about _product_.

--

Students work in teams to produce a software product of their choosing.

# Topics

## Agile development

We will learn **agile development**'s origins.

--

- In what contexts are "agile" principles useful.

--

- What are its own unique challenges.

--

- In particular, we will follow the **Scrum framework** for agile development.

---

## Javascript stack

We will dive head-first into the **Javascript stack** for web app development. In particular, the **MERN stack**.

--

- **M**ongoDB as the **database**

--

- **E**xpress.js for the **back-end**.

--

- **R**eact.js for the **front-end**

--

- **N**ode.js as our general Javascript programming environment.

--

You will absorb HTML, CSS, and Javascript through **osmosis**...

--
unless you're not paying attention.

---

template: topics

## We will learn through osmosis?

Yes.

--

- This is perhaps the biggest topic of the course... how to teach yourself what you don't know.

---

template: topics

## User experience design

You will have to figure out how to determine what makes a good experience versus a mediocre or terrible one.

---

template: topics

## Skills we will develop

You cannot do contemporary work without some fundamental skills.

--

- Basic UNIX/Linux commands

--

- Version control (i.e. `git` and `GitHub`)

--

- Automating the boring parts (i.e. ssh, unit testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment)

---

template: topics

## Questions we will answer

There are common questions we will aim to answer:

--

- What is The World Wide Web?

--

- How do you do _xyz_?

--

- I have an idea for an app... is it hard to do?

--

- Should I go to a start-up academy, or just study at NYU CS?

--

- My internship requires me to know _express-validator_.... what is that?

--

- My friend is making mad money at a start-up using MongoDB... can I learn that?
