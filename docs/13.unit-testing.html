# Overview

--

## Concept

A unit is the smallest testable unit of code - typically a function, but sometimes an object or class.

--

- Unit testing verifies that each unit behaves as expected, given specific inputs.

---

template: overview

## Background

Unit testing is an automated testing technique developed in 1992 by Kent Beck to solve the annoyance of manually testing code for obvious errors.

--

- originally written in Smalltalk

--

- JUnit created by Beck as a way to teach himself Java during the course of an airplane flight from Zurich to Upsalla in 1997

--

- shared with Martin Fowler, a fellow signatory with Beck of the Agile Manifesto, who helped spread it

--

- now ported to just about every high-level programming language

---

template: overview

## Other languages

The world of unit testing frameworks for different languages that are based on the original JUnit is called **xUnit**.

--

- all open source, since JUnit was released open source

--

- all written in the same language that they are testing

---

# Advantages

--

## Comparison to Alternative

Automated unit testing has many advantages over manual debugging:

--

- less time consuming and tedious

--

- requires fewer human resources

--

- provides immediate feedback of failures

--

- allows developers to focus more on writing code

--

- more reliable than manual testing

---

template: advantages

## Relationship to Refactoring

Refactoring of existing code involves rewriting it to make it better organized and efficient without changing its observable behavior.

--

- It is often necessary to refactor code to make it more easily tested with unit tests - keep each function short and focused on a single task.

--

- With automated unit testing, refactoring will not accidentally introduce errors, since any such errors that change the behavior of the code will be immediately detected by the tests (called regression tests in this context).

# Examples

--

## Java

A unit test example in Java using JUnit:

--

```java
// include JUnit and assertion libraray
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MyFirstTest {

    @Test
    public void multiplicationOfZeroIntegersShouldReturnZero() {
        MyClass tester = new MyClass(); // MyClass is tested

        // assert statements for a variety of test cases
        assertEquals(0, tester.multiply(10, 0), "10 x 0 must be 0");
        assertEquals(0, tester.multiply(0, 10), "0 x 10 must be 0");
        assertEquals(0, tester.multiply(0, 0), "0 x 0 must be 0");
    }
}
```

## Javascript

A unit test example in Javascript using mocha:

--

```javascript
// use mocha's built-in assertion library
const assert = require("assert");

// a set of tests of array functions
describe("Array", function () {
  // one particular unit test
  describe("#indexOf()", function () {
    // assert what should be returned
    it("should return -1 when the value is not present", function () {
      // test that assertion
      assert.equal(-1, [1, 2, 3].indexOf(4));
    });
  });
});
```

name: test-cases

# Test Cases

--

## Minimal Number

Unit tests must test at least two scenarios, called `test cases`:

--

- test the expected output when given valid input

--

- test the expected output when given invalid input

--

In actuality, there will be multiples test cases for every possible variety of valid and invalid input.

---

name: assertions

# Assertions

--

## Concept

Every unit testing framework depends upon a set of **assertions** - purported truths that are then compared against reality.

--

- An assertion is a statement that a particular predicate is going to be true - this is either true or false.

--

- If false, the assertion fails and throws an error about what went wrong and where that happened in code

---

template: assertions
name: assertions-1

## Typical Assertions

This is a partial list of methods in JUnit's asssertion library that all other testing frameworks tend to imitate:

--

### Equality:

- `assertEquals(primitive/object expected, primitive/object actual)`
- `assertNotEquals(primitive/object expected, primitive/object actual)`
- `assertArrayEquals(expectedArray, actualArray)`

---

template: assertions-1

### Truth:

- `assertTrue(boolean condition)`
- `assertFalse(boolean condition)`

---

template: assertions-1

### Existence:

- `assertNull(Object object)`
- `assertNotNull(Object object)`

---

template: assertions-1

### Sameness:

- `assertSame(object1, object2)`
- `assertNotSame(object1, object2)`

# Best Practices

## TRIPinesss

According to "[Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit](https://pragprog.com/titles/utj/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-java-with-junit)", by Andy Hunt and Dave Thoma, good unit tests are **TRIP-y**:

--

- **T**horough

--

- **R**epeatable

--

- **I**ndependent

--

- **P**rofessional

---

template: best-practices

## Three pillars

According to Roy Osherove, author of "[The Art of Unit Testing](https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing)", there are three main pillars of a good unit test:

--

- **Trustworthiness** - if you don't believe your test, and find yourself verifying it or ignoring it, it's a sign you should rewrite it.

--

- **Maintainability** - a test that is difficult to maintain and takes up more time than it saves might as well be scrapped

--

- **Readability** - a test that is not obvious as to what it's testing is a bad test. Tests serve as a form of documentation.

name: doubles

# Doubles

--

## Concept

Unit tests must run in isolation of one another and of external dependencies, such as databases, APIs, or other servers.

--

- Some units of production code normally depends upon an interaction with such a dependency. What to do?

--

- Swap out that dependency with the double! - a controlled simulation of the dependency.

--

- Using a double will allow you to hone in on problems with your own code, not problems within the external dependency.

---

template: doubles

## Types of double

There are three commonly-used types of doubles.

--

- Mocks

--

- Fakes

--

- Stubs

---

template: doubles

## Mocks

Mocks are replacements for external interfaces.

--

- The mock assumes the same name and functions as the mocked external dependency.

--

- Using a mock can determine only whether the mock has been called or not by production code, how many times it has been called, and whether or not the correct arguments are passed to it when it is called.

--

- Production code does not need to be changed to use a mock. It does not "know" that it is not connecting to the real thing.

--

- The testing framework takes care of swapping out the external dependency with a mock.

---

template: doubles

## Stubs

Whereas mocks are called by production code and passed arguments in place of a real external dependency, stubs are used to return pre-defined responses to the calling code.

--

- For example, if your app code requires a record to be saved in a database, you might create a mock to intercept the arguments that would normally be sent to the database in place of the real thing, and create a stub that responds with a success or failure message in place of the real response that the database would send, given the supplied parameters.

--

- Having a mock send back a stub allows you to use unit tests to determine whether your production code handles the response correctly.

---

template: doubles

## Fakes

Like, mocks and stubs, fakes are used in the simulation of an external dependency. But whereas mocks and stubs are simple code substitutions for the real thing, a fake is an actually functioning replacement for the external dependency that runs on the local machine.

--

- For example, if your code must connect to an API over the Internet, you might create a local HTTP server that simulates that API as your fake so you can test as if it were real.

--

- Since unit tests must run independently of one another, any data sent back and forth with the fake will not be saved and will not influence subsequent unit tests that interact with the fake - there is no saved state within the fake.

--

- The advantage of using fakes over mocks and stubs is that you get a slightly more "real" test.

# Javascript Testing Tools

--

## Recommendations

The following are the recommended tools for unit testing in Node.js Javascript.

--

- [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) as the Javascript testing framework.

--

- [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) as the assertion library.

--

- [istanbul / nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) for code coverage analysis.

--

- [sinon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) for stubs, mocks, and fakes.

--

- [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) for any placeholder data that needs to be generated in tests (e.g. names, email addresses, database data, images, etc)
