# The Internet

---

template: internet
name: internet-1

## Definition
The Internet is the global interconnected network of computers that communicate via a set of standardized protocols.

---

template: internet-1
name: internet-2

- It is sometimes referred to as a "network of networks."

---

template: internet
name: internet-3

## Connective tissue
The vast expanses of the Internet's reach are today enabled primarily by fiber optic cables that run locally, regionally, and across ocean floors to connect continents.

Copper wires and radio signals account for a smaller fraction of the total distance traveled by data on the Internet.

---

template: internet
name: internet-4

## Origins
The Internet evolved over decades, funded primarily by the US Department of Defense
- US Department of Defense networking projects in the 1960s explored fault-tolerant networks resistent to nuclear attack
- The ARPANET, a mostly regional network in the 1970s-80s, attempted to improve interoperability among different computer systems
- transitioned to the Internet in 1980s-90s, a global network of interoperable computers

## Ownership
The "backbone" of networking equipment that fuels the Internet belongs to a patchwork of different interests:
- telecommunications companies and other private corporations
- federal, state, and local government
- academia
- military

---

template: internet
name: internet-5

## Cooperation
Given the patchwork of operators controlling different parts, cooperation is key.
- Organizations of approximately equal size that provide key parts of the Internet backbone usually abide by a "free peering" agreement, whereby they agree to relay each others' data across their own network hardware for free.
- Organizations of different sizes who need to cooperate often work out payment agreements to let traffic from one travel over the other's equipment

## Control
The Internet, for better or worse, has been much touted as a disruptive force in society.

---

template: internet-6
name: internet-7

- A decade or two ago, many saw the Internet as a [democratizing force](https://blogs.harvard.edu/idblog/2008/05/14/the-democratic-power-shift-on-the-internet/) for peoples everywhere.

---

template: internet-7
name: internet-8

- Today, some point out a [more complicated situation](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/books/review/Siegel-t.html) where information and access to that information is controlled by corporate and government interests.

---

template: internet
name: internet-9

## Control
The Internet, where anyone anywhere can *share* information, *steal* information, *surveil* and *influence* populations on the other side of the globe, is increasingly the site of a struggle for *information dominance*.

# The World Wide Web

---

template: web
name: web-1

## Definition
The World Wide Web is one use of the Internet to publish and browse hypertext documents.

---

template: web
name: web-2

## Hypertext
"Hypertext" means documents which reference and link to one-another.

---

template: web-2
name: web-3

- The hypertext concept was first popularized by Dr. Vannevar Bush in a 1945 article in The Atlantic titled, "[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)".

---

template: web-3
name: web-4

- Vannevar Bush was then the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the US military.

---

template: web-4
name: web-5

- After World War II, where he managed miliatry scientific research including the development of the atomic bomb, Bush turned his sights on the problem of information overload.

---

template: web
name: web-6

## Origin
The World Wide Web was invented in 1989-1990 by a British researcher at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee.

---

template: web-6
name: web-7

- Berners-Lee acknowledged that his invention was really a mashup of existing concepts, including hypertext, the Internet, and multi-font text.

---

template: web-7
name: web-8

- Inventing The Web required him to think at a higher level of abstraction and generalization to envision the value of this combination.

---

template: web-8
name: web-9

- He then invented Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that is used to write web documents, and created the first web browser, the first web server, and invented the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate with a specific set of commands.

---

template: web-9
name: web-9a

- He released his code free and open source, of course.

---

template: web
name: web-10

## Definition (revisited)
In the past, it was simple to define the World Wide Web.

---

template: web-10
name: web-11

- the use of a web browser to browse hypertext documents on the Internet

---

template: web-11
name: web-12

- use of the HTTP protocol by clients and servers to request and receive information

---

template: web
name: web-13

## Definition (revisited)
Today, the situation is a bit more blurry.

---

template: web-13
name: web-14

- Many apps besides web browsers now allow users to publish and read public and private hypertext documents over the Internet

---

template: web-14
name: web-15

- HTTP is now used to do much more than transferring hypertext documents - it is being used for all kinds of file transfers, messaging, virtual meetings, and more.

---

template: web-15
name: web-16

- other protocols, such as [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), can now be used to transfer hypertext documents ... are these web pages?

---

template: web-16
name: web-17

- Are these using the web?

# Clients and servers

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-1

## Definitions
- a **client** is any machine on a network that is requesting data from a *server*.

---

template: clients-servers-1
name: clients-servers-2

- a **server** is any machine that is responding to a request for data from a *client* machine.

---

template: clients-servers-2
name: clients-servers-3

- a single machine may sometimes act the role of a client in one interaction and the role of a server in another.

---

template: clients-servers-3
name: clients-servers-4

- the terms *client* or *server* can also be used to refer to the specific software on the client or server machine that is handling the communication in question.

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-5

A client makes a request to a server.

![Client server request](../images/client_server_request.png)

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-6

The server responds to the client.

![Client server response](../images/client_server_response.png)

---

template: clients-servers
name: clients-servers-8

A single server typically handles requests from many clients.

![Client server multiplicity](../images/client_server_multiplicity.png)

---

name: http

# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

---

template: http
name: http-1

## Standardized requests and responses
The HTTP specification indicates 
- how Web clients can make requests to Web servers
- how Web servers can respond to those requests from Web clients

---

template: http
name: http-2

## Plain text
HTTP request and response commands are sent as plain text over the network, following a specific format.
- for added security, the **HTTPS** "secure" extension of HTTP encrypts the request and response communication while in transit

---

template: http
name: http-3

## Request types
The two most widely used [request types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) allowed by the HTTP specification
- **GET** - a web client requests that the web server respond by giving it a specific information resource, such as a web page
- **POST** - a web client supplies some data to the web server along with the request with the intention that the server save that data, or at least use it to changee its behavior in some way

---

template: http-3
name: http-4

- other HTTP request types do exist, but are less widely used.

---

template: http
name: http-5

## Response codes
Web server responses include a [status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), indicating the success or failure of the client's request.
- **200** to **299**: success
- **400** to **499**: client error
- **500** to **599**: server error
- and more...

name: http-6

## Example of a web client GET request
```http
GET /some_document.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: knowledge.kitchen
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
```

# Front-End Technologies

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-1

## Overview
Front-end technologies are those languages or programs which are interpreted and executed by the client, typically a web browser.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-2

## Separation of concerns

Different front-end languages perform different purposes
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-3

## HTML
Used to indicate the content and semantic *meaning* of the content on a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-4

## CSS
Used to indicate the style and presentation of a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-5

## Javascript
Used to indicate interaative behaviors of a web page.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-6

## It's up to a client's interpretation
A web browser client receives the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code from the server, and then interprets it.

---

template: front-end
name: front-end-7

## Frameworks
Front-end frameworks attempt to simplify and streamline the process of creating front-end interfaces.

---

template: front-end-7
name: front-end-8

- **Bootstrap** - a framework ,originally by Twitter, with readymade CSS and Javascript code that handles many common interface design needs

---

template: front-end-8
name: front-end-9

- **Material UI** - a competitor to Bootstrap, by Google, specifically design to modularly fit into any project using React

---

template: front-end-9
name: front-end-10

- **React** - a framework, by Facebook, that attempts to abstract and streamline the process of generating the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for a web or mobile app; allows for easy sharing among projects of modular "components" and behaviors

---

template: front-end-10
name: front-end-11

- **AngularJS** - a competitor to React, by Google

---

name: back-end

# Back-End Technologies

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-1

## Overview
Back-end technologies are those languages or programs used to control the behavior of the server and how it responds to various kinds of client requests.

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-2

## Server's control what the client views
The server can be programmed to modify thee HTML, CSS, and Javascript code that is sent to the client in response to the request.

![Client server responsibilities](../images/client_server_front_back_ends.png)

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-3

## Examples
For example, back-end programming on the server-side might allow a web server to...
- Send a Spanish version of a web page to a user whose browser's HTTP request said it prefers Spanish, and an English version of the same page to a browser with English as its language setting.

---

template: back-end-3
name: back-end-4

- Send a mobile version of a web page to a user whose browser's HTTP request said it is running on a mobile device, and a desktop version of the same page to a browser whose HTTP request says it's on a desktop computer.

---

template: back-end-4
name: back-end-5

- Send the client a web page that automatically includes today's news today and tomorrow's news tomorrow, rather than sending the client the same news articles every day.

---

template: back-end-5
name: back-end-6

- Allow a server to "remember" what products each user adds into their shopping cart; and show all users the same shopping cart web page, but with their own individual products displayed in it, not someone else's.

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-7

## Popular back-end programming languages
Just about any high-level programaming language of note can be used to control how a web server responds to requests.
- **Node.js (server-side Javascript)**
- **Ruby**
- **Python**
- **PHP**
- **C#**
- **ASP**

---

template: back-end
name: back-end-8

## Frameworks
The choice of frameworks to simplify the process of writing server-side code depends on which server-side programming language is being used.
- PHP projects often use **Laravel** or **Sympfony** frameworks
- Node.js (server-side Javascript) usually use the **Express** framework
- Ruby projects usually use the **Rails** framework
- Python projects usually use the **Django** or **Flask** frameworks
- C# projects usually use the **.NET** framework
- ASP projects usually use the **.NET** framework

name: databases

# Databases

---

template: databases
name: databases-1

## Overview
A database is any technology used to store data
- fast storage and retrieval
- easy integration with back-end technologies and programming languages

---

template: databases
name: databases-2

The server-side code usually communicates with the database to save new data sent from the client, or to retrieve existing data and use it to determine how to respond.

![Client-server-database](../images/client_server_databases.png)

---

template: databases
name: databases-3

## Popular back-end databases for web sites and apps
Relational databases based on the SQL language have traditionally dominated since the 1970's.
- Oracle
- MS SQL
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Amazon Aurora
- ... and more

---

template: databases
name: databases-4

## Popular back-end databases for web sites and apps
However NoSQL databases are now surging, due to the changing expectations of web and mobile app developers and those using cloud-based infrastructure.
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Google Firebase
- Amazon DynamoDB
- ... and more

---

template: databases
name: databases-5

## Serverless databases
A growing market is the "serverless database", where the server provides the initial front-end code to the client, but further data is sent/received by front-end Javascript directly to/from the database.

![Serverless databases](../images/client_server_databases_serverless.png)

---

template: databases
name: databases-6

## Front-end data storage for web apps
There are some limited data storage capabilities of web browsers, where data used by a web site is stored locally on the client machine.
- **Cookies** - often used to store tracking codes that are secretly passed to the server in an HTTP header with every request
- **LocalStorage** - often used to store larger block of data, such as web pagee content that can be displayed even when browser is offline

# Monolithic vs microservices architectures

---

template: microservices
name: microservices-1

## Monolithic architecture
What we have been discussing until now is termed a **monolithic** architecture

---

template: microservices-1
name: microservices-2

- One server directly handles all back-end tasks

---

template: microservices-2
name: microservices-3

- The "traditional" architecture for web and mobile apps

---

template: microservices-3
name: microservices-4

- Over time, the codebase tends to grow *larger*, *more complex* and *tangled* and becomes difficult to maintain

---

template: microservices
name: microservices-5

## Microservices architecture
A growing trend for scalable apps is the **microservices architecture**.

![Microservices](../images/client_server_microservices.png)

---

template: microservices
name: microservices-6

## Microservices architecture
- Multiple single-purpose servers each handle a single discrete duty of the back-end. 

---

template: microservices-6
name: microservices-7

- Each microservice has its own codebase maintained independently of the others.

---

template: microservices-7
name: microservices-8

- There is no need for all microservices to use the same technology stack... not stuck with legacy codebase.

---

template: microservices-8
name: microservices-9

- A "gateway API" server coordinates the calls to the microservices and provides a unified API to the client.
