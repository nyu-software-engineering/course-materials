# Overview

--

## Concept

Javascript, also known as ECMAScript, has a few unusual features that trouble programmers of other languages.

--

- loose typing of variables, and type 'coercion'

--

- prototypal inheritance (no classes!)

--

- insular jargon like 'hoisting', 'closures', 'destructuring', and 'unpacking'

--

- two comparison operators, == and ===

--

- at least 5 different syntaxes for defining functions

--

- several different ways to instantiate objects

--

- two very different common use-cases: client-side and server-side programming

--

- three different ways to handle asynchronousity

---

template: overview

## Try it yourself

Try out the code examples in this deck for yourself: https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/javascript-crash-course

---

name: basics

# The Basics

--

## Variable declaration

Three keywords to declare a variable:

--

- **let** - for defining block-scoped variables

--

- **const** - for defining block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned to a new value

--

- **var** - for defining function-scoped variables, or global variables if not declared within a function...
  _supported for legacy purposes and should not be used in new code_

---

template: basics

## Let example

```javascript
// non-constant variables are declared with the let keyword
let it = true // it's true!

it = it ? false : true // reassign it to be its opposite using the ternary operator

console.log(`It is ${it}!`) // expected output: 'It is false!'
```

---

template: basics

## Const example

```javascript
// constants are declared with the const keyword
const data = [10, 20, 30] // a variable that can't be reassigned!

data[1] = "ha!" // but this is not variable reassignment!

console.log(data) // expected output: [10, 'ha!', 30]
```

---

template: basics

## Scope example

Imagine the following code?

```javascript
let x = 5

{
  let x = 10
}

console.log(x)
```

What is output?

---

template: basics

## Output to console

Basic output to the console

```javascript
let stuff = "some text"

console.log("This is " + stuff + ".") // expected output: 'This is some text.'
```

---

template: basics

## String templates

Template syntax enapsulating a string with backtics

```javascript
let stuff = "some text"

console.log(`This is ${stuff}.`) // expected output: 'This is some text.'
```

--

Template syntax will accept any expression

```javascript
const x = 5
const y = 10

console.log(`The result is ${x + y}.`) // expected output: 'The result is 15.'
```

---

template: basics

## For loops

The expected behavior.

```javascript
// iterate 5 times
for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
  console.log(`For loop iteration #${i}`)
}
```

--

```javascript
// infinite loop
for (let i = 1; true; i++) {
  console.log(`For loop iteration #${i}`)
}
```

--

```javascript
// finite loop
for (someValue in someArray) {
  console.log(`The value is ${someValue}`)
}
```

---

template: basics

## While loops

The expected behavior.

```javascript
// iterate 5 times
let i = 1
while (i < 6) {
  console.log(`While loop iteration #${i}`)
  i++
}
```

--

```javascript
let i = 0
while (true) {
  console.log(`While loop iteration #${i}`)
  i++
}
```

---

template: basics

## Equality

The `==` operator compares by value _with type coercion_.

```javascript
1 == "1" // true
true == 1 // true
undefined == null // true
```

---

template: basics

## Equality

The `===` operator compares by value _without any type coercion_.

```javascript
1 === "1" // false
true === 1 // false
undefined === null // false
```

---

template: basics

## Semi-colons

Semi-colons are optional, as long as each statement is written on its own line.

```javascript
1 === "1" // false
true === 1 // false
undefined === null // false
```

--

- do not use them, if you can help it.

---

name: functions

# Regular Functions

--

The `function` keyword.

```javascript
// define a function the most simple way
function doSomething1() {
  console.log("doSomething1 is running")
}
doSomething1() // call the function
```

---

template: functions

And with _parameters_/arguments...

```javascript
// define a function the most simple way with two parameters
function doSomething2(x, y) {
  console.log(`doSomething2 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`)
}
doSomething2("hello", "world") // call the function with arguments
```

---

template: functions

And with a _return_ value...

```javascript
// define a function the most simple way with two parameters and a return value
function doSomething3(x, y) {
  const msg = `doSomething3 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`
  return msg
}
console.log(doSomething3("hello", "world")) // call the function and use its return value
```

---

name: anonymous-functions

# Anonymous Functions

--

Functions in Javascript can be nameless.

```javascript
// define an anonymous function
function () {
  console.log("doSomething1 is running")
}
```

--

You may be wondering how you call a function with no name.

---

template: anonymous-functions

One way to call an anonymous function is to assign a _variable_ to point to it.

```javascript
// define an anonymous function, but assign a variable to refer to it
const doSomething1 = function () {
  console.log("doSomething1 is running")
}

doSomething1() // call the function
```

---

template: anonymous-functions

And with _parameters_...

```javascript
// define an anonymous function with parameters, but assign a variable to refer to it
const doSomething2 = function (x, y) {
  console.log(`doSomething2 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`)
}

doSomething2("hello", "world") // call the function with arguments
```

---

template: anonymous-functions

And with a _return_ value...

```javascript
// define an anonymous function with parameters and a return value, but assign a variable to refer to it
const doSomething3 = function (x, y) {
  const msg = `doSomething3 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`
  return msg
}

console.log(doSomething3("hello", "world")) // call the function and use its return value
```

---

name: arrow-functions

# Arrow functions

--

A simplified function syntax without the `function` keyword.

```javascript
// an arrow function with no parameters or return value
const doSomething1 = () => {
  console.log("doSomething1 is running")
}

doSomething1() // call the function
```

---

template: arrow-functions

And with parameters...

```javascript
// an arrow function with parameters
const doSomething2 = (x, y) => {
  console.log(`doSomething2 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`)
}

doSomething2("hello", "world") // call the function with arguments
```

---

template: arrow-functions

And with a return value...

```javascript
// an arrow function with parameters and a return value
const doSomething3 = (x, y) => {
  const msg = `doSomething3 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`
  return msg
}

console.log(doSomething3("hello", "world")) // call the function and use its return value
```

---

template: arrow-functions

Function syntax can be even further reduced if all it does is return a value.

```javascript
const doSomething4 = (x, y) => `doSomething4 is running with x=${x} and y=${y}.`

console.log(doSomething4("hello", "world")) // call the function and use its return value
```

---

template: arrow-functions

Even further reduced syntax with no parentheses around a single parameter:

```javascript
const doSomething5 = x => `doSomething5 is running with x=${x}.`

console.log(doSomething5("hello")) // call the function and use its return value
```

---

template: arrow-functions

Note that with this shorthand return statement, if the value returned is an object, that object **must** be encapsulated in parentheses.

```javascript
const getFoo = () => ({ first: "Foo", last: "Barstein" })
```

---

name: iife

# Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions

--

Wrapping a function in parentheses turns it into an expression.

```javascript
;(function doSomething() {
  console.log("doing something")
})
```

--

Note that it is convention to place a semi-colon (`;`) before an immediately-invoked function in order to ensure it is interpreted as a separate statement from whatever comes above it in the code.

---

template: iife

This allows it to be immediately called, if desired.

```javascript
;(function doSomething() {
  console.log("doing something")
})()
```

---

template: iife

An anonymous arrow function turned into an IIFE:

```javascript
;(() => {
  console.log("doing something")
})()
```

---

template: iife

Put onto one line.

```javascript
;(() => {
  console.log("doing something")
})()
```

---

template: iife

Similar, but different.

```javascript
;(message => console.log(message))("doing something")
```

---

name: objects

# Objects

--

## Instantiating objects

Javascript objects are usually instantiated directly, without the need for a class.

```javascript
// an object
const me = {
  name: "Foo Barstein",
  phone: "212-666-1212",
  age: 63,
  isRobot: false,
}
```

--

Methods can be tacked onto extant objects.

```javascript
me.speak = function (message) {
  console.log(`${this.name} says, "${message}".`)
}

me.speak("Hello!") // expected output: 'Foo Barstein says, "Hello!".'
```

---

template: objects

## Instance methods

There is a special shorthand syntax if declaring methods within objects

```javascript
const fido = {
  name: "Fido",
  breed: "Schnauzer",
  bark(message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} says, '${message}'`)
  },
}

fido.bark("Woof!")
```

---

template: objects

## Objects can be sub-classed by simply copying them

Javascript uses prototypal inheritance, where one object uses another as the prototype from which it is based.

```javascript
// make a copy of an object - this is prototypal inheritance
const robotMe = Object.create(me) // creates a new object based on the original prototype
robotMe.isRobot = true // modify this new object in some way

console.log(`me ${me.isRobot ? "is indeed" : "is not"} a robot.`) // expected output: "My name is Foo Barstein"
console.log(`robotMe ${robotMe.isRobot ? "is indeed" : "is not"} a robot.`) // expected output: "My name is Foo Barstein"
```

--

Changes to methods or properties can be added onto the cloned object to differentiate it from its "parent".

```javascript
// add robot-specific speach abilities
robotMe.speak = function (message) {
  console.log(
    `${this.name} the robot states in monotonous voice, "${message}".`
  )
}
```

---

template: objects

## Methods in objects

The `this` keyword refers to the object a method is called on.

```javascript
// an object with a method belonging to it
const fido = {
  name: "Fido",
  breed: "Schnauzer",
  bark(message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} says, '${message}'`)
  },
}

// call the bark method on the fido object
fido.bark("Woof!") //expected output: "Fido the Schnauzer says, 'Woof!'"
```

---

template: objects

## Functions are classes... or classes are functions

Objects can alternatively be instantiated by calling a function using the **new** keyword.

```javascript
function Dog(name, breed) {
  this.name = name
  this.breed = breed
  this.bark = message => {
    console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} says, '${message}'`)
  }
}

// instantiate an object and call its method
let fido = new Dog("Fido", "Schnauzer")
fido.bark("Woof!")
```

---

template: objects

## Constructing objects with a class definition

Objects can alternatively be instantiated from a class definition. This is `syntactic sugar` and not a real feature of the language.

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name
    this.breed = breed
  }
  bark(message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} the ${this.breed} says, '${message}'`)
  }
}

// instantiate an object and call its method
let fido = new Dog("Fido", "Schnauzer")
fido.bark("Woof!")
```

---

name: arrays

# Arrays

--

## Basics

Arrays behave as expected.

```javascript
// generate an array from a string
let fruits = "avocado,tomato,banana".split(",") // returns ['avocado, 'tomato', 'banana']
console.log(`Do you love ${fruits[1]}?`) // expected output "Do you love tomato?"
```

--

```javascript
// add an element to an array
fruits.push("pepper") // fruits now has ['avocado, 'tomato', 'banana', 'pepper']
```

--

```javascript
// find index position of element by value
const fruit = "pepper"
let pos = fruits.indexOf(fruit) // returns 3
console.log(`${fruit} is located in the array at index ${pos}.`)
```

---

template: arrays

## Basics

Continued.

```javascript
// delete last element from the array
fruits.pop() // fruits now has ['avocado, 'tomato', 'banana']
```

--

```javascript
// indexOf returns -1 if value not found in arraay
pos = fruits.indexOf("pepper") // 'pepper' is no longer there, so -1 is returned
console.log(`${fruit} is now located in the array at index ${pos}.`)
```

--

```javascript
// join all elements in array into a comma-separated string
const stringAgain = fruits.join(",") // returns 'avocado,tomato, banana'
console.log(`The fruits are ${stringAgain}.`)
```

---

template: arrays

## forEach function

Calls a function for each element in an array.

```javascript
const numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4]

numbers.forEach(n => {
  console.log(n)
})
```

---

template: arrays

## Map function

Creates a new array containing the results of a function call for each array element. Useful for transforming array values.

```javascript
const numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4]

const newNumbers = numbers.map(n => n * 10)

// newNumbers now refers to [650, 440, 120, 40]
```

---

template: arrays

## Filter function

Create a subset of an array.

```javascript
let fruits = "avocado,tomato,banana".split(",") // ['avocado, 'tomato', 'banana']

// create a new array with a subset of the original values
fruits = fruits.filter((val, i, arr) => {
  return val != "banana" // returns true for all fruits except 'banana'
})

console.log(fruits) // expected output: ['avocado', 'tomato']
```

---

template: arrays

## Arrays of objects

A common data format used by [APIs](#apis) to pass data between clients and servers.

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Boa, emerald green tree",
    price: "$31.82",
    description: "Sed ante. Vivamus tortor. Duis mattis egestas metus.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Bleu, blue-breasted cordon",
    price: "$35.66",
    description:
      "Praesent blandit. Nam nulla. Integer pede justo, lacinia eget, tincidunt eget, tempus vel, pede.",
  }, // imagine there were more product objects...
]
```

```javascript
// loop through each product
products.forEach(product => {
  // print the title and price of each product
  console.log(`${product.title} - ${product.price}`)
})
```

---

name: higher-order-functions

# Higher Order Functions

--

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

```javascript
// a simple function that prints out its argument
const foo = val => {
  console.log(`val = ${val}`)
}
```

--

```javascript
// another function that takes another function as its argument
const bar = (func, arg) => {
  func(arg) // call the function that was received, whatever it is, and pass it the argument that was received
}
```

--

```javascript
// pass the foo function to the bar function as an argument
bar(foo, 5)
```

---

name: asynchronicity

# Asynchronicity

--

## Overview

Javascript has three features to handle asynchronicity in code.

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/await

---

template: asynchronicity

## Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that will be called when a certain task completes.

```javascript
// a function that accepts two callbacks - one for success, one for failure
let doIt = (callbackSuccess, callbackFailure) => {
  // imagine this function did an asynchronous task and then...
  // - called callbackSuccess() function if task is successful
  // - called callbackFailure() function if task failed
}

// call the function, pass two callback functions to handle its success or failure
doIt(
  res => {
    console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
  },
  err => {
    console.log(`Failure: ${err}`)
  }
)
```

---

template: asynchronicity

## Promises

Promises are a language feature that allow programmers to specify two functions: one to be called automatically when a certain asynchronous task is successfully completed and another to be called when that task fails.

```javascript
// a function that returns a Promise
let doIt = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // imagine this function did an asynchronous task and then...
    // - called resolve('hooraah') if task is successful
    // - called reject('boo!') if task failed
  })
}

// call the function, pass functions to handle its success or failure, whenever it completes
doIt()
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(`Failure: ${err}`)
  })
```

---

template: asynchronicity

## Async

The `async` keyword works on top of Promises to make their syntax simpler to read.

- It can be placed in front of any function definition - this means the function's return value is guaranteed to be returned as a Promise, regardless of what the return statement says.

```javascript
let doIt = async () => {
  // this function automatically returns a Promise, even if it doesn't say so
  return "hoorah!" // 'hoorah' will be automatically passed as the argument to the resolve function of the Promise
}

// we can the function call as if it returns a Promise, which it does.
doIt()
  .then(res => {
    console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(`Failure: ${err}`)
  })
```

---

template: asynchronicity

## Await

The `await` keyword forces the program to wait for a Promise to complete before moving on to the next line of code. It allows us to write code in a familiar manner, even when dealing with asynchronous Promises.

```javascript
let doIt = async () => {
  // this function automatically returns a Promise, even if it doesn't say so
  return "hoorah!" // 'hoorah' will be automatically passed as the argument to the resolve function of the Promise
}

const res = await doIt()
console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
```

---

template: asynchronicity

## Await (continued)

There is only one complication: `await` can only be used within an `async` function.

```javascript
let doIt = async () => {
  // this function automatically returns a Promise, even if it doesn't say so
  return "hoorah!" // 'hoorah' will be automatically passed as the argument to the resolve function of the Promise
}

let start = async () => {
  // await is only allowed within an async function
  const res = await doIt()
  console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
}
start()
```

---

template: asynchronicity

## Await (continued again)

A standard `try`/`catch` statement is the simplest way to handle both success and failure of a Promise when using `await`.

```javascript
let doIt = async () => {
  // this function automatically returns a Promise, even if it doesn't say so
  return "hoorah!" // 'hoorah' will be automatically passed as the argument to the resolve function of the Promise
}

let start = async () => {
  // await is only allowed within an async function
  try {
    const res = await doIt() // run the function that returns a Promise, wait for completion
    // handle success
    console.log(`Success: ${res}`)
  } catch (err) {
    // handle failure
    console.log(`Failure: ${err}`)
  }
}
start()
```

---

name: apis

# Using APIs

--

## Concept

When a client requests data from a server, that data must be returned in a particular format the client can parse.

- The servers always return text (i.e. strings) in their HTTP responses
- For simple static web content, that format of the data is simple HTML returned by the server
- For more complex needs, [Javascript Object Notation](https://knowledge.kitchen/Introduction_to_JSON) (JSON) is the preferred format.
- Once on the client side, this JSON is interpreted as Javascript code.

---

template: apis

## Example

Fetching data from APIs requires asynchronous programming.

```javascript
const https = require("https") // using Node's built-in http module for http requests
const apiUrl = "https://my.api.mockaroo.com/users.json?key=d9ddfc40" // a mock-API for demo purposes that returns a JSON array of objects

// make an HTTP request to the API server
https
  .get(apiUrl, response => {
    response.on("data", chunk => {
      // this callback function is called automatically every time a chunk of data has been recieved from the server.
    })

    response.on("end", () => {
      // this callback function is caalled automatically when all data has been received from API
    })
  })
  .on("error", err => {
    // this callback function is called automatically if there is an error
  })
```

---

name: destructuring

# Destructuring

--

## Arrays

Values in an array can be extracted into separate variables upon assignment:

```javascript
const [a, b] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] // a=10, b=20
```

--

The remaining values can be lumped together - this is _rest syntax_:

```javascript
const [c, d, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] // c=10, d=20, rest=[30,40,50]
```

--

Function parameters can follow this same syntax:

```javascript
function foo(a, b, ...args) {
    console.log(`a = ${a}, b = ${b}`, args = ${args}`) // args = [30, 40, 50]
}
foo(10, 20, 30, 40, 50) // pass values as separate arguments
```

---

template: destructuring

## Spread syntax

Spread syntax is the opposite of rest syntax - it dissolves an array into separate values in particular contexts.

Such as when passing an array of arguments to a function.

```javascript
// a function that accepts two separate arguments
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y
}
let args = [10, 20]
let total = sum(...args) // spread the values in the array into multiple arguments
```

--

Or copying values from one array into another...

```javascript
let myVals = [1, 2, 3, ...[4, 5, 6]] // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

template: destructuring

## Objects

Values within an object can be destructured.

Take this object with a nested sub-object as a starting point...

```javascript
const person = {
  age: 72,
  name: "Foo Barstein",
  email: "fb1258@teleworm.us",
  address: {
    street: "92 Rue Jamil Sedki",
    city: "Beni Brahim",
    country: "Tunisia",
    postalCode: 7040,
  },
}
```

--

```javascript
const { name, age } = person // name='Foo Barstein', age=72
console.log(`name = ${name}`) // expected output: 'Foo Barstein'
console.log(`age = ${age}`) // expected output: 72
```

---

template: destructuring

## Objects

Variable names do not need to match field names:

```javascript
const { name: fullName, age: apparentAge } = person // { fullName: 'Foo Barstein', apparentAge: 72 }
console.log(`fullName = ${fullName}`) // expected output: 'Foo Barstein'
console.log(`apparentAge = ${apparentAge}`) // expected output: 72
```

--

Nested objects can be destructured as well:

```javascript
const {
  email,
  address: {
    city, // create a variable for this field only
  },
} = person
console.log(`email = ${email}`) // expected output: 'fb1258@teleworm.us'
console.log(`city = ${city}`) // expected output: 'Beni Brahim''
```

---

name: importing

# Importing & Exporting

--

## Concept

Javascript today allows modular reuse of your own code or that of 3rd parties through its module functionality.

--

- the Node Package Manager (NPM) provides easy ways to manage the download, installation, and configuration of open soure 3rd party code libraries.

--

- Node supports two different ways of importing/exporting modules: the [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) way, and the [ECMAScript 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015) (ES6) way - these are competing standards.

--

- Node originally supported the CommonJS module specification before ES6 was released, since there was nothing in the ECMAScript specification for importing/exporting at that time.

--

- Once ES6 arrived, Node added support for its module specification, but a special `'type': 'module'` setting must be added to every Node project's config file named `package.json` for the ES6 module functionality to kick in.

---

template: importing

## CommonJS exporting

Basic CommonJS exporting syntax:

```javascript
// imagine you had a variable foo, a function bar, and an object baz - all can be exported

// export these all to make them available for import into another Javscript file
module.exports = { foo, bar, baz } // note the CommonJS syntax!
```

--

With CommonJS, you could also have exported each variable individually:

```javascript
module.exports.foo = 5 // a number
module.exports.bar = () => {
  console.log("hello world!")
} // a function
module.exports.baz = { x: 5, y: 10 } // an object
```

--

Or even without the `module` prefix:

```javascript
exports.foo = 5 // a number
exports.bar = () => {
  console.log("hello world!")
} // a function
exports.baz = { x: 5, y: 10 } // an object
```

---

template: importing

## CommonJS importing

Import named exports using the `require` function:

```javascript
const { foo, bar, baz } = require("./10.exporting")
```

--

Or import the entire module and access the named exports separately:

```javascript
const myModule = require("./10.exporting") // import module as a whole

console.log(myModule.foo) // access a value exported in the module
myModule.bar() // access a function exported in the module
```

## ES6 exporting

Basic ES6 exporting syntax:

```javascript
// imagine you had a variable foo, a function bar, and an object baz - all can be exported

// export these all to make them available for import into another Javscript file
export { foo, bar, baz } // note the ES6 syntax!
```

--

With ES6, you could also have exported each variable individually:

```javascript
export let foo = 5 // a number
export let bar = () => {
  console.log("hello world!")
} // a function
export let baz = { x: 5, y: 10 } // an object
```

--

Or you can specify one of them as the `default` export, if desired:

```javascript
export let foo = 5 // a number
export default let bar = () => { console.log('hello world!') } // a function
export let baz = { x: 5, y: 10 } // an object
```

## ES6 importing

Import named exports using the `import` keyword:

```javascript
import { foo, bar, baz } from "./10.exporting"
```

--

Or give each import a different name than in the module:

```javascript
import { foo as f, bar as b1, baz as b2 } from "./10.exporting"
```

--

If the module specified a `default` export, we can import only that - note the syntax:

```javascript
import bar from "./10.exporting"
```

--

We can also import the default export in combination with some named exports:

```javascript
import bar, { foo, baz } from "./10.exporting" // the default export is 'bar'
```

# Implementation Differences

## Differences

Javascript can be run either _within a web page_ loaded by a web browser (i.e. client-side) or _on an HTTP server_ using Node.js. There are some key differences.

--

- _Javascript in the web browser_ is primarily focused on interacting with the browser's [Document Object Model](https://knowledge.kitchen/Document_Object_Model) (DOM) - an object created automatically by the browser itself that contains and allows the Javsacript to modify all the contents, styles, and behaviors of the web page currently loaded in the browser's memory.

--

- _Node.js runs on the server_, where there is no currently-loaded web page. So the DOM does not exist and is not of any use in controlling server behavior. Node.js has its own set of [built-in variables and objects](https://knowledge.kitchen/Node.js_notes#Global_variables).

---

## Differences (continued)

- There are _myriad web browsers_ with _myriad different versions_ in active use by people across The Web. Programming Javascript that will work in all of them usually means taking a _lowest-common denominator approach_ and sticking to language features that have been supported by browsers for many years.

--

- Unlike with the web browser, _you control the server_, including which version of Javascript is supported. So you can guarantee support for whichever version of Node.js you choose to program in.

## Browser example

Imagine the following HTML code for a button and a picture of a donkey.

```html
<button id="clickme">Click me please</button>
<img id="neigh" src="images/donkey.jpg" />
```

--

And let's say the following CSS code hid the donkey:

```css
/* this will cause the donkey to be hidden when the page first loads */
img#neigh {
  display: none;
}
```

--

The following client-side Javascript, using the popular [JQuery](https://jquery.com) framework, will wait for the user to click the button and then will run the callback function:

```javascript
$("button#clickme").click(function () {
  // make donkey will appear
  $("img#neigh").show()
})
```

---

## Server example

The following server-side code uses the popular [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework.

```javascript
// set up a 'route'... i.e. a callback function to run when a particular request comes in
app.get("/foo", (request, response) => {
  response.send("bar") // send the response
})

// another one just for fun... this one waits for an HTTP POST request for the same URL
app.post("/foo", (request, response) => {
  // let's assume the client has sent some POST data with the user's name
  response.send(`Hello, ${req.body.name}!`) // send the response
})
```
