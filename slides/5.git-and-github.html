# Introductions

--

## Git

The world's most popular open source version control system.

--

- **Distributed** - all developers maintain and share the code in their own local repositories, with no single central authority.

--

- **Repository versioning** - a new version number is issued for the repository as a whole, even when only one file has changed.

--

- Created by **Linus Torvalds** to help Linux kernel developers collaborate

---

template: introductions

## GitHub

A web app used for hosting remote Git repositories.

--

- Free hosting of public open-source projects

--

- Free hosting of private projects for students (or so I hear)

--

- Acquired by Microsoft for \$7.5 billion in 2018

---

# Three-Tier Model

---

template: tiers

Git version control depends upon three tiers, or three places where files are stored.

- Working copy
- Staging index
- Repository

![Git tiers](../images/git_tiers.png)

---

template: tiers

## Working copy

The copy of the files that a developer works on.

--

- Not tracked by git.

--

- Your 'normal' files you are familiar with.

--

![Working tree](../images/git_working_tree.png)

---

template: tiers
name: staging-index

## Staging index

A holding area for changes that _might_ be included in the project's official history.

--

- Allows developers pick and choose which changed files to include in the next commit to the repository

--

- [Read more](https://gitolite.com/uses-of-index.html) about some benefits of this

--

![Staging index](../images/git_staging_index.png)

---

template: staging-index

```bash
# add any changed files within the working directory to the staging index
git add .
```

--

```bash
# add only one file to the staging index
git add my_staging_index_slide.md
```

---

template: tiers
name: repository

## Repository

The official history of the project, including the history of all committed files.

--

- With each commit, changed files in the staging index are moved to the repository

--

- A short message describes the chanes included in each commit

--

![Repository](../images/git_repository.png)

---

template: repository

```bash
# commit any files in the staging index to the repository
git commit -m "Updating slide about git repositories"
```

# Git Terminology

--

A few terms we must familiarize ourselves with.

- Clone
- Fork
- Main
- Branch
- Remote
- Pull
- Push
- Merge
- Fetch

---

template: terminology
name: clone

## Clone

A new repository made by copying files from an existing repository.

--

- Typically involves creating a new local repository that is a copy of an existing remote repository.

--

- The new repository automatically keeps a link to the `origin` remote repository from which it came.

--

```bash
# clone a remote repository onto the local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-github-handle/your-repository-name.git
```

---

template: clone

![Clone](../images/git_clone.png)

---

template: terminology
name: fork

## Fork

Not a Git term, but rather a term used by remote repository hosting providers such as GitHub.

--

- A fancy word for creating a remote [clone](#clone) of a remote repository.

--

- A fork of a GitHub repository creates a clone of that repository in the active user's own GitHub account

---

template: fork

![Fork](../images/git_fork.png)

---

template: terminology
name: main

## Main

The Git term for the `trunk` line of code.

--

- The default line of code that all commits are placed into unless other branch lines are created.

--

![Main branch](../images/git_main.png)

---

template: terminology
name: branch

## Branch

The term for an offshoot of the `trunk` or `main` line of code.

--

- creating a branch allows developers to work on new code in isolation with no effect on the main `trunk` line.

--

- code in a branch can be `merged` into the trunk branch at any time, if desired

--

![Feature branch](../images/git_branch.png)

---

template: branch

```bash
# see a list of all branches in the local repository
git branch
```

--

```bash
# create a new branch
git branch experiment1
```

--

```bash
# switch to the new branch
git checkout experiment1
```

--

```bash
# switch back to the main branch
git checkout main
```

---

template: terminology
name: remote

## Remote

A term used to mean a remote repository that the local repository is linked to.

--

- Typically, this refers to the remote repository from which a local repository was cloned.

--

- The nickname `origin` is usually used to refer to the original remote repository from which the local repository was cloned.

--

- The nickname `upstream` is also sometimes used to refer to a remote repository from which the `origin` repository was originally forked.

---

template: remote

```bash
# view a list of all currently known remotes
git remote -v
```

--

```bash
# inform git of a remote and give it the nickname 'origin'
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-handle/your-repository-name.git
```

--

```bash
# inform git of a remote and give it the nickname 'upstream'
git remote add upstream https://github.com/some-other-github-handle/some-other-repository-name.git
```

---

template: terminology
name: pull

## Pull

Download and merge any changes _in the current branch_ from a remote repository to the local repository.

--

- It's good practice to `pull` before you `push`.

--

![Pull](../images/git_pull.png)

---

template: pull

```bash
# download and merge any changes in the main branch from the 'origin' remote repository to the local repository
git pull origin main
```

--

```bash
# download and merge any changes in the main branch from the 'upstream' remote repository to the local repository
git pull upstream main
```

---

template: terminology
name: push

## Push

Upload changes from the local repository to a remote repository.

--

![Push](../images/git_push.png)

---

template: push

```bash
# Upload any changs in the main branch from the local repository to the 'origin' remote repository
git push origin main
```

--

```bash
# Upload any changs in the main branch from the local repository to the 'upstream' remote repository
git push upstream main
```

---

template: terminology
name: fetch

## Fetch

Download but do not automatically merge any changes _in the current branch_ from a remote repository to the local repository.

--

- This is similar to `git pull`, but `pull` automatically merges any changes into the current branch, while `fetch` does not.

--

```bash
# fetch any changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin
```

--

```bash
# fetch any changes from the 'upstream' remote repository
git fetch upstream
```

---

template: terminology
name: merge

## Merge

Take the changes from one branch or repository and incorporate them into another branch or repository.

--

- If both branches include recent changes to the same lines of code, `git` will inform you of a conflict.

--

- Any such merge conflicts must be manually resolved using your preferred editor.

--

![Merge](../images/git_merge.png)

---

template: merge

- A typical workflow:

```bash
git pull origin # get latest code in all branches from the remote origin server

git checkout some-branch-name # switch to a branch where you will make changes in isolation... either first create this branch with 'git branch some-branch-name' or do 'git checkout -b some-branch-name' to create it and check it out at once

# make some chages to the code in this branch, if desired using your preferred editor

git checkout main # switch back to the main branch to prepare to merge

git pull origin main # download any recent changes from the origin server

git merge some-branch-name # incorporaate your changes in the branch into the code in the main branch

git branch -d some-branch-name # delete the branch now that we're done with it
```

---

name: local-repository

# Creating a Local Repository

--

A local repository can be created in one of two ways.

--

## From scratch

```bash
mkdir project0
cd project0
git init
```

--

If you later decide to link a local repository to a remote repository:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

--

## As a clone of another repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

---

name: tracking

# Tracking Changes with the Local Repository

--

Changes in the Working Copy (adding, modifying, or deleting files) are not tracked.

Files must be added to the staging index in order to be tracked.

--

## Add files to the staging index

Make any changes you desire.

Then add all the modified files in working copy to the staging index:

```bash
git add .
```

---

name: committing

# Committing Changes to the Local Repository

--

The staging index does not maintain the history of all changes.

Changes must be moved to the repository in order to be fully archived.

--

```bash
git commit -m 'resolving bug #23'
```

---

name: sharing

# Sharing Changes with Other Developers

--

Any changes to the local repository must usually be shared with other developers.

For this reason, they should frequently be uploaded to a shared remote repository.

---

template: sharing

## Pushing changes to the remote repository

Push the code in the current branch from the local repository to the branch named 'main' on the remote repository called 'origin':

```bash
git pull
git push -u origin main
```

--

Or, if you are already in the 'main' branch and the remote named 'origin' has already been defined:

```bash
git pull
git push
```

---

name: conflicts

# Merge Conflicts

--

Conflicts may occur in a number of scenarios:

- When `pulling` code from a remote repository to a local repository.
- When `pushing` code from a local repository to a remote repository.
- When merging code from one branch into another.
- When merging code from one repository into another.

--

Git will merge code automatically, if possible, and ask the developer to do it themselves, if not.

---

name: configuration

# Configuration

--

Several important configurations that must be completed prior to versioning:

- username and email address
- .gitignore

---

template: configuration

## Username and email

Username and email in Git must match exactly any username and email set up on GitHub:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Foo Barstein"
git config --global user.email "fb1258@nyu.edu"
```

---

template: configuration

## .gitignore

A file in the project directory named `.gitignore` instructs Git to ignore certain files or directories.

--

This _absolutely must_ include instructions to ignore any platform code and 3rd party modules.

--

View an [example](https://gist.github.com/bloombar/1bbca4aafb267920ac220864d99d6c8f)
