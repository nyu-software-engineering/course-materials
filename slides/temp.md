## Course description

We learn an engineering approach to the problem of software development.

--

This course is as much about **tools** and **best-practices** as it is about **finished products**.

--

Students work in teams to produce several software products.

# Topics

template: topics

## Software development process models

We will learn about the difficulties of building software and a few different approaches to the problem:

--

- The advantages and disadvantages of "Big Design Up Front" (BDUP)

--

- The so-called "agile" or iterative approach and where it fails

---

template: topics

## Planning

We will write specifications and build clickable prototypes of software applications that meet the needs of their users. This involves:

--

- requirements gathering

--

- user experience design

--

- rapid prototyping

---

template: topics

## Web application development

We will sojourn through full-stack development of web application developments, using a Python-based technology stack:

--

- MongoDB as the **database**

--

- Flask for the **back-end**.

--

- raw HTML & CSS for the **front-end**.

---

## Continuous integration

We will learn to write tests that validate our code behaves as expected and automate the boring job of repeatedly running those tests repeatedly with every code change.

---

template: topics

## Continuous deployment

We will learn to launch software on the Internet and how to automate the boring job of re-launching it with every code change.

---

template: topics

## Skills we will develop

You cannot do contemporary work without some fundamental skills.

--

- Basic UNIX/Linux commands

--

- Version control (i.e. `git` and `GitHub`)

--

- Teamwork and collaboration

## Texts

No single textbook is necessary nor sufficient for this course. We will refer to various online resources where relevant.

--

- Our technology stack is very popular, with plenty of good documentation and tutorials.

## Install these now

You will need a variety of software tools. Here are a few to set up right now.

--

- Git - [for Mac](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

--

- A UNIX-like shell, such as in Mac's **Terminal** or **Git Bash** (part of Git for Windows) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

--

- an account set up on [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

--

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

--

- [Discord](https://discord.com)

## Setting Up Bash within Visual Studio Code

WINDOWS USERS - you should use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) rather than Windows' default Powershell or other command line shell program. To set Git Bash or WSL as the default terminal shell within Visual Studio Code, you can try to follow the instructions in [the second answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) by **Mahade Walid** and edited by **FruityOatyBar** (ignore the first answe, which is outdated).
