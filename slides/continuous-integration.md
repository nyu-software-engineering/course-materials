# Overview

--

## Concept

As developers work on a project, they make changes.

--

- Every time a change is made, there is a risk of bugs being introduced.

--

- In order to discover bugs, the software must be periodically built and tested.

--

- **Continous Integration (CI)** is the automated process of building and testing software everytime a component of the system changes.

---

template: overview

## Benefits

Automated Continuous Integration has several benefits:

--

- uncover bugs more quickly through frequent builds, tests, and notifications

--

- improve quality

--

- reduce time to validate builds

--

- reduce human labor costs

# Typical Workflow

--

## Overview

![Continuous Integration process diagram](../images/continuous_integration_process.png)

---

template: ci-workflow

## Version Control

When a developer makes changes to a system, they typically check those changes into a version control system.

--

- A continuous integration server will be notified whenever a new change has been made.

--

- This notification can arrive either by continually polling the version control logs looking for changes, or by receiving an API call (i.e. a hook) from the version control system when a change is made.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Build System

Once a change to the version control repository has been detected, the Continous Integration server will automatically trigger a new build to begin in order to be able to test the system once the build is done.

--

- Build Systems typically remove any artefacts from previous builds, and assemble the system from scratch.

--

- Builds can occur on a developer's local machine, on a build server, or even on the target production server.

--

- In a Continuous Integration pipeline, once the build is done, the testing framework begins running automated tests.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Testing Framework

Once a fresh build is complete, the testing framework will run automated tests on the system.

--

- Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests, and any other tests that support automation can all be executed.

--

- Once testing is complete, developers are notified of the success or failure of all tests.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Notifications

Developers are notified, immediately upon completion of the build and test phases, whether each of the steps succeeded or failed.

--

With most Continuous Integration tools, notifications can be sent via

--

- email

--

- SMS

--

- Slack, Discord, or MS Teams messages

--

- notification apps

--

- calls to any arbitrary API endpoint for custom notifications or follow-up automated steps

---

template: ci-workflow

## Badges

In popular project management tools such as GitHub, badges automatically posted to a repository's README.md can indicate the last known success or failure of the build and tests for all to see.

# Best Practices

--

## Commit small changes

Committing small changes to version control limits the scope of what has changed so failures in building or testing are more quickly identified and remedied.

---

template: best-practices

## You break it, you fix it!

If a given developer has broken the build, it is their responsibility to fix it.

--

- Developers are often expected to be _always on call_ to fix broken builds...

--

- ... or whatever else a manager thinks is important.

---

template: best-practices

## Test the right stuff

It's common to miss obvious bugs because automated unit and integration tests have poor code coverage or test the wrong things.

--

- This is a problem with all unit testing and is not unique to Continuous Integration automation of those tests.

---

template: best-practices

## What to produce

Plan on producing a status, a log, and an artefact.

--

- the **status** is the result, whether the build succeeded or failed

--

- the **log** contains a list of the steps that were completed in the build, and the results of all tests

--

- the **artefact** can be anything that is intended to be produced by the CI server, such as the built software in a bundled and ready-to-deply form, or a generated report on the code coverage of the unit tests, or an auto-generated web page documenting the system, etc.

# Software as a Service

--

## Continuous Deployment

An extension of Continuous Integration is Continuous Deployment (CD)...

--

- Assuming Continuous Integration build/test passes, the CI/CD automation server takes the additional step of...

--

- Deploying (cloning, installing and running) the built system on a production server - the server where customers can immediately access the latest version.

---

template: software-as-service

## CI/CD Automation pipelines

Continuous Integration (CI), followed by Continuous Deployment (CD) goes hand-in-hand with **Software as a Service** (SaaS).

--

- SaaS systems are deployed not to the customers' local machines, but to the software distributor's own servers.

--

- Doing so allows the software distributor to maintain control and ownership of software at all times while granting access to the software to customers / end-users, rather than actually deploying software on customers' own machines.

--

- Since changes to the source code immediately trigger new builds and deployment of the latest code, customers will always have immediate access to the latest stable version of the software.

# Circle CI

--

## Hosted continuous integration service

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com) is a proprietary hosted Continuous Integration web service with a free tier of service that is suitable for small projects.

---

template: circle-ci

## Virtual build servers

When a change is detected in version control, Circle CI boots up a new virtual server.

--

- Circle CI clones the version control repository into the virtual machine, and performs the build and test.

---

template: circle-ci

## Key features

Circle CI comes with the common features of any continuous integration server.

--

- hosted continuous integration solution

--

- free tier

--

- at its simplest, requires the addition of a configuration file to a repository

--

- supports building and testing of many programming languages

--

- integrates with other popular DevOps tools and practices

---

template: circle-ci

## Basic configuration

Circle CI's build and test configuration is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) (YAML Ain't Markup Language) and saved into a file named `config.yml` in a `.circleci` directory of your project.

--

- See an [example config for a React.js/Express.js-based app](https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/generic-project-repository/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

---

template: circle-ci

## GitHub integration

To link Circle CI to a GitHub repository, such that it detects changes to the repository and triggers continuous integration builds and testing, go to [circleci.com](https://circleci.com).

--

- Follow the instructions there to link to a GitHub repository. You will be asked to authorize the app on GitHub, and then can modify settings within the travis web app. The setup is relatively straightforward.

--

- As a best practice, have Circle CI _perform automated builds on pull requests_. This allows the pull request reviewer to be sure the code builds and passes automated tests prior to merging the code.

---

template: circle-ci

## Highly configurable

Circle CI supports detailed instructions and can run arbitrary code at various lifecycle points in the build.

---

template: circle-ci

## Messenger integration

Circle CI can send notifications to Discord, Slack, MS Teams or other messenger apps indicating the results of the latest build.

--

- To do so, the Circle CI app must be authorized for the given messenger app workspace.

--

- So your instructor may, unfortunately, be reluctant to allow this.

---

template: circle-ci

## Badges

You can embed build status badges that Circle CI will use to automatically _show the latest status of your build_ into your project's `README.md`.

--

- The Markdown code to use for status badge images are shown on your Circle CI project settings page, and are something like:

```
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/software-assignments-spring2022/your-repo-name-here/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/software-assignments-spring2022/your-repo-name-here/tree/master)
```

---

template: circle-ci

## Warnings Cause Build Failure

By default, both _errors_ and _warnings_ produced by a project will cause the continuous integration server to fail the build.

--

- React.js projects are particularly prone to issuing many warnings that cause the build to fail.

--

- if an environment variable `CI` is set to `false`, most continuous integration servers will ignore warnings.

--

- For a React.js project, set this environment variable by modifying the `build` script in the `package.json` file to: ` "build": "CI=false && react-scripts build"`

--

- For other types of projects, it is possible to set this environment variable directly within the workflow file.

# GitHub Actions

--

## Overview

Like other continuous integration services, GitHub Actions is a hosted service that runs automated builds, tests, and other processes on a virtual machine.

---

template: github-actions

## Virtual build servers

When a change is detected in version control (whether a push, pull request, merge, or other), GitHub Actions boots up a new virtual server.

--

- GitHub Actions clones the version control repository into the virtual machine, and performs the build and test.

---

template: github-actions

## Key features

GitHub Actions comes with the common features of any continuous integration server.

--

- hosted continuous integration solution

--

- free tier

--

- at its simplest, requires the addition of a configuration file to a repository

--

- supports building and testing of many programming languages

--

- integrates with other popular DevOps tools and practices

---

template: github-actions

## GitHub integration

As a part of a GitHub repository, GitHub Actions does not need any special setup in order to detects change to the repository and trigger continuous integration builds and testing.

--

- As a best practice, have GitHub Actions _perform automated builds on pull requests_. This allows the pull request reviewer to be sure the code builds and passes automated tests prior to merging the code.

--

- This also better conserves the free executable minutes given to the repository owner's account.

---

template: github-actions

## Basic configuration

Configuration files, known as "workflows", are written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) (YAML Ain't Markup Language).

--

- configuration files are stored in a `.github/workflows` directory in the project repository.

--

- workflows in GitHub Actions, as in other automation tools, can run aribtrary shell commands to perform any task.

--

- GitHub maintains a marketplace of [pre-built actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) that can be used in your own custom workflows.

--

- GitHub Actions currently offers a limited number of execution minutes [for free](https://github.com/pricing), and charges for additional usage.

---

template: circle-ci

## Highly configurable

GitHub Actions supports detailed instructions and can run arbitrary code at various lifecycle points in the build.

---

template: github-actions

## Example

A [Python build/test workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python) that runs on every pull request. [Linting using pylint](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=pylint+) or other code linter could easily be added.

```
name: Python build test
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.6", "3.8", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pytest
```

name: github-actions

## Badges

You can embed build/test [status badges](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) that GitHub Actions will use to automatically _show the latest status of your build_ into your project's `README.md`.

--

- The Markdown code to use for status badge images are shown on your GitHub Actions project settings page, and are something like:

```
![Your custom badge name](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/actions/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILE>/badge.svg)
```

---

template: github-actions

## Messenger integration

GitHub Actions can send notifications to Discord, Slack, MS Teams or other messenger apps indicating the results of the latest build.

--

- To do so, GitHub Actions must be authorized for the given messenger app workspace.

--

- So your instructor may, unfortunately, be reluctant to allow this.
